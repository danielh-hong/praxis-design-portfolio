          <h3><strong>My Initial Engineering Position:</strong></h3>
          <p></p><hr><p></p>

          <p>
              In January, my position as an engineering designer was deeply rooted in a 
              philosophy of perfectionism. Still attached to my high school views, I held 
              a deeply rooted internal belief that all the things I did, and all the products 
              I created, had to be of seamless functionality, flawless design, and 
              unparalleled aesthetics. 
          </p>
          <p>
              At the time, I did not realize this; I thought I had 
              let go of my high school ideals — I thought I was beyond perfectionism. In 
              my initial position statement, I even talked about discipline, repetition, 
              teamwork, and structure, even explicitly reasoning with myself to not include 
              perfectionism, as I had grown out of it.
          </p>
          <p>
              However, now in April, 4 months later, I see in hindsight that those values 
              of discipline, repetition, teamwork, and structure were just the tangible 
              realizations of my perfectionism. They were concrete expressions that 
              supported my illusion of having transcended perfectionism, when, in fact, 
              I was still very much stuck in the middle of it. This perspective, while 
              thorough and not fundamentally "bad", often prioritized flawless execution 
              over all else, which impacted both the speed of development of products and 
              designs, and also often the creative scope.

          <h3><strong>My Evolution in Position:</strong></h3>
          <p></p><hr><p></p>

          <p>
              My second semester in the Engineering Science program has brought a lot of changes to my life. 
              Taking 6 courses, all of which I no longer have prior knowledge, joining two design teams, 
              taking on my own little projects, balancing health, and getting exposure to actual engineering 
              design has challenged me to rethink the practical implications of perfectionism, and to 
              recognize the limitations they were placing on me in terms of innovation and actual design.
          </p>
          <p>
              Specifically, taking on actual engineering projects, conversing with other 
              students and professors, and learning about the the engineering process in 
              Praxis has made me realize that my fundamental value in perfectionism was hindering me, 
              as it caused me to strive for stable, solid solutions and products that I 
              thought could be perfect on all fronts rather than outside the box, 
              unbelievable solutions.
          </p>
          <p>
              I have come to believe now that the essence of engineering isn't found in the 
              flawless execution of an idea but rather in the boldness of the concept itself. 
              True innovation requires stepping beyond the bounds of conventional perfection 
              to embrace the potential of groundbreaking ideas, and accepting that along the 
              way, there will be countless stumbles, trips, and bruises. I now see
              that if the final product doesn't work on all fronts; that's okay. 
              Now, I truly believe that
              <strong>It's the idea that matters.</strong>
          </p>

          <h3><strong>Current Engineering Philosophy:</strong></h3>
          <p></p><hr><p></p>

          <p>
              Today, my design philosophy is driven by an "innovation-first" approach. 
              My new position emphasizes:
          </p>
          <ul class="about_list">
              <li>Valuing Visionary Ideas: Prioritizing the pursuit of ambitious, even 
                seemingly unreachable goals, as idea is key.</li>
              <li>Thinking Outside the Box: Encouraging unconventional thinking, 
                "unbelievable aspects", that challenges the acceptable and the common, 
                knowing that while perfection may not always be achievable, the pursuit 
                itself and unconventional thinking can lead to extraordinary developments.</li>
              <li>Embracing the Art of the Possible: Focusing on what could be, 
                rather than what already is—pushing the limits of current technologies 
                and methodologies to explore new possibilities.</li>
              <li>Dreaming Big: Pursuing ambitious ideas. Believing that by reaching high,
                even if the final product doesn't work on all fronts, the journey and 
                the idea itself is what matters.</li>
              <li>Being open to all possibilities; you never can fully know whether something 
                will work or not until you try it.
              </li>
          </ul>
          <p></p>
          <p>
              This new approach and position is not about forgoing precision or quality 
              but about recalibrating the balance between perfection and innovation. 
              It's about understanding that while the path to an ideal solution is 
              important, the real impact often lies in daring to imagine and attempting 
              the extraordinary. It's about utilizing my strengths in creativity and 
              outside-the-box thinking to create meaningful ideas that can might, one 
              day, be accepted into this quickly advancing world.
          </p>
          <p>
              Now, to me, <strong>It's about thinking unconventionally. It's about being creative.
              It's about pursuing the ecentric ideas. It's about embracing the difficulty.</strong>
          </p>

              <strong>🗣 Communication and Presentation 🗣</strong> 
              <p></p>
              I strongly believe that communication, presentation, and representation 
              are one of the most important parts of any project. Without clearly 
              communicating a design to an audience, the design is essentially as 
              good as nothing. 
              <br>
              <p></p>
              Years of competing in DECA, acting classes, as well 
              as countless presentations has made presentation and communication one 
              of my prominent skills, which I demonstrate in projects such as Pocket 
              Fridge (see projects tab), where my team and I effectively communicated 
              our prototype to win the hackathon.

              <p></p>
              As I have iterated repeatedly, creativity--thinking outside the box--is 
              now a key cornerstone to 
              my engineering design approach. Years of engagement in arts, music, and 
              orchestra have developed my creativity, helping my ability to generate 
              solutions.

              <p></p>
              My background in Track and Field has built into me a sense of 
              discipline and meticulous planning. The rigorous training I endured 
              for years has taught me to always trust in the process, to always 
              put in one hundred percent, and to trust that by putting in the work and 
              following the plan,
              good things will ultimately happen.

              <strong>🤝 Teamwork 🤝</strong>
              <p></p>
              Successfully teamwork is essential for success. Working with 
              others cohesively, and seeing different branches of a project come 
              together into a final, working product is one of the most satisfying 
              parts of any design endeavour. I value teamwork deeply, and always make sure 
              to communicate with team members to ensure that everyone is content 
              with their undertakings and feels fully supported. Having a team that works 
              well together--a team that can take and give feedback,
              plan, and organize--can be the difference between a good project, and a great one.

              <strong>👁️ Visualization 👁️</strong>
              <p></p>
              As a learner, my strength comes in the form of visualization.
              I prefer to see images and graphs of things, rather than hearing spoken or written instruction.
              As such, in all my design activities, I seek to more easily visualize designs by
              creating sketches, diagrams, and 3D models. It is only through these models that I feels
              I can truly understand the design, its strengths and weakness, and its implications.

              Pocket Fridge is a design project that I worked on with my team (Brian Zhang, Patrick Huang, Sally Jeong)
              for my second hackathon ever, the Google GenAI Genesis Hackathon (2024).

              Pocket Fridge is an app that scans your receipts, identifies the food items on that receipt, keeps track of the expiration dates,
              places those foods into your 
              'virtual fridge', and then suggests recipes based on the foods you have. 

              
              We came up with this idea when reflecting on our own lives as university students, realizing how 
              busy life could be, how little time there was to think of 
              nutritious recipes, and how easy it was to forget about what's already in your fridge.

              This idea was the product of hours of brainstorming and outside-the-box thinking.
              True to my Engineering position, Plcket Fridge
              was indeed an unbelievable and ambitioius idea. None of us had any experience working with Gemini AI
              , but we were 
              determined to make it work. Ultimately, we managed to the app working, ending up winning the hackathon."

              <strong>🛠️ How we built it 🛠️:</strong>
              We built Pocket Fridge primarily using the MERN stack, integrating MongoDB for data storage,
              Express.js to handle API requests, React Native for a convenient front-end user interface, 
              and Node.js (hosted/deployed on Railway) for server-side logic.

              We explored countless other technologies throughout this project too, creating a Flask Rest API 
              hosted on Google Cloud to leverage Vertex AI (Gemini Pro Vision, Gemini Pro, and Imagen) and 
              rigorously analyze grocery receipts."

              <strong>💻 How it works (Technical Details) 💻:</strong> Upon the upload of a receipt photo to the app,
                our AI Gemini model — trained using Vertex AI, implemented with Python, and deployed on 
                Google Cloud as an API with Flask — begins its work. Our Gemini AI model analyzes the 
                receipt photo to identify food items and predicts their expiration dates using its cloud 
                capabilities. The data, formatted in JSON, is then sent to the frontend React Native code which 
                reads it in and organizes the different items into the virtual pantry, while keeping track 
                of their predicted expiration dates. Our second AI Gemini model, also harnessed with Vertex AI, 
                takes these identified items and concocts various recipes. This AI creates step-by-step images 
                for each recipe, enhancing user convenience. 🍳"

              <strong>💻 Technical Details Continued 💻:</strong> The AI models are the main 
              branches that I worked on in this project. Coming into the competition, I had very little 
              experience working with AI API's, especially not the newly released Gemini and Google models. 
              This project was therefore quite a challenge. However, 
              harnessing my creativity, discipline, and problem solving skills, I was able to learn how to use
              Vertex AI, Google Cloud API Deployment, and countless other technologies within the 48 hours to integrate
              our AI models into our project. Overall, this demonstrates my key values of discipline as well
              as my important value of 'thinking big'; doing things that I have never done before, and pushing the limits of
              what I think is possible."

              we were exhausted at the end of the 48 sleepless hours, we ensured to prepare a professional presentation,
              creating thoughtful slides, app mockups, as well as prepping well-rehearsed demos.

              Praxis II, the second Engineering Design course in the Engineering Science Program at UofT, was a 4 months 
              design course in which I worked with Samuel Ho, Allan Zhou, and Ran Chi to create designs for an opportunity
              of a community of our choice. Our community was Allan Gardens, and our opportunity was to help 
              them separate red wiggler worms from the vermicompost with minimal manual labour, as many of the volunteers
              at Allan Gardens were older folks that needed to use a lot of effort to remove worms for vermicomposting.
              More details of this project can be seen in our  one pager which highlights our final design (pdf above)"

              This picture features our group practicing for our final presentation at the Praxis Showcase.
              We spent about 3-7 hours daily practicing for this final presentation, in hopes that we could
              completely familiarize ourselves with our key 
              points. However, the most important reason for practicing together was to ensure not just a smooth and 
              seamless presentation, but to ensure we were helping each other improve 
              by giving each other constructive feedback. This is a key value that I hold in my engineering that I elaborated
              on in my position, and that I hold dear to my core. Having a team that can give and take feedback, and work
              well together can make or break the project, and so I always take steps to ensure that our team is working
              effectively and cohesively."
