          <h3><strong>My Initial Engineering Position:</strong></h3>
          <p></p><hr><p></p>

          <p>
              In January, my position as an engineering designer was deeply rooted in a 
              philosophy of perfectionism. Still attached to my high school views, I held 
              a deeply rooted internal belief that all the things I did, and all the products 
              I created, had to be of seamless functionality, flawless design, and 
              unparalleled aesthetics. 
          </p>
          <p>
              At the time, I did not realize this; I thought I had 
              let go of my high school ideals — I thought I was beyond perfectionism. In 
              my initial position statement, I even talked about discipline, repetition, 
              teamwork, and structure, even explicitly reasoning with myself to not include 
              perfectionism, as I had grown out of it.
          </p>
          <p>
              However, now in April, 4 months later, I see in hindsight that those values 
              of discipline, repetition, teamwork, and structure were just the tangible 
              realizations of my perfectionism. They were concrete expressions that 
              supported my illusion of having transcended perfectionism, when, in fact, 
              I was still very much stuck in the middle of it. This perspective, while 
              thorough and not fundamentally "bad", often prioritized flawless execution 
              over all else, which impacted both the speed of development of products and 
              designs, and also often the creative scope.

          <h3><strong>My Evolution in Position:</strong></h3>
          <p></p><hr><p></p>

          <p>
              My second semester in the Engineering Science program has brought a lot of changes to my life. 
              Taking 6 courses, all of which I no longer have prior knowledge, joining two design teams, 
              taking on my own little projects, balancing health, and getting exposure to actual engineering 
              design has challenged me to rethink the practical implications of perfectionism, and to 
              recognize the limitations they were placing on me in terms of innovation and actual design.
          </p>
          <p>
              Specifically, taking on actual engineering projects, conversing with other 
              students and professors, and learning about the the engineering process in 
              Praxis has made me realize that my fundamental value in perfectionism was hindering me, 
              as it caused me to strive for stable, solid solutions and products that I 
              thought could be perfect on all fronts rather than outside the box, 
              unbelievable solutions.
          </p>
          <p>
              I have come to believe now that the essence of engineering isn't found in the 
              flawless execution of an idea but rather in the boldness of the concept itself. 
              True innovation requires stepping beyond the bounds of conventional perfection 
              to embrace the potential of groundbreaking ideas, and accepting that along the 
              way, there will be countless stumbles, trips, and bruises. I now see
              that if the final product doesn't work on all fronts; that's okay. 
              Now, I truly believe that
              <strong>It's the idea that matters.</strong>
          </p>

          <h3><strong>Current Engineering Philosophy:</strong></h3>
          <p></p><hr><p></p>

          <p>
              Today, my design philosophy is driven by an "innovation-first" approach. 
              My new position emphasizes:
          </p>
          <ul class="about_list">
              <li>Valuing Visionary Ideas: Prioritizing the pursuit of ambitious, even 
                seemingly unreachable goals, as idea is key.</li>
              <li>Thinking Outside the Box: Encouraging unconventional thinking, 
                "unbelievable aspects", that challenges the acceptable and the common, 
                knowing that while perfection may not always be achievable, the pursuit 
                itself and unconventional thinking can lead to extraordinary developments.</li>
              <li>Embracing the Art of the Possible: Focusing on what could be, 
                rather than what already is—pushing the limits of current technologies 
                and methodologies to explore new possibilities.</li>
              <li>Dreaming Big: Pursuing ambitious ideas. Believing that by reaching high,
                even if the final product doesn't work on all fronts, the journey and 
                the idea itself is what matters.</li>
              <li>Being open to all possibilities; you never can fully know whether something 
                will work or not until you try it.
              </li>
          </ul>
          <p></p>
          <p>
              This new approach and position is not about forgoing precision or quality 
              but about recalibrating the balance between perfection and innovation. 
              It's about understanding that while the path to an ideal solution is 
              important, the real impact often lies in daring to imagine and attempting 
              the extraordinary. It's about utilizing my strengths in creativity and 
              outside-the-box thinking to create meaningful ideas that can might, one 
              day, be accepted into this quickly advancing world.
          </p>
          <p>
              Now, to me, <strong>It's about thinking unconventionally. It's about being creative.
              It's about pursuing the ecentric ideas. It's about embracing the difficulty.</strong>
          </p>

              <strong>🗣 Communication and Presentation 🗣</strong> 
              <p></p>
              I strongly believe that communication, presentation, and representation 
              are one of the most important parts of any project. Without clearly 
              communicating a design to an audience, the design is essentially as 
              good as nothing. 
              <br>

              Years of competing in DECA, acting classes, as well 
              as countless presentations has made presentation and communication one 
              of my prominent skills, which I demonstrate in projects such as Pocket 
              Fridge (see projects tab), where my team and I effectively communicated 
              our prototype to win the hackathon.

              <p></p>
              As I have iterated repeatedly, creativity--thinking outside the box--is 
              now a key cornerstone to 
              my engineering design approach. Years of engagement in arts, music, and 
              orchestra have developed my creativity, helping my ability to generate 
              solutions.

              <p></p>
              My background in Track and Field has built into me a sense of 
              discipline and meticulous planning. The rigorous training I endured 
              for years has taught me to always trust in the process, to always 
              put in one hundred percent, and to trust that by putting in the work and 
              following the plan,
              good things will ultimately happen.

              <strong>🤝 Teamwork 🤝</strong>
              <p></p>
              Successfully teamwork is essential for success. Working with 
              others cohesively, and seeing different branches of a project come 
              together into a final, working product is one of the most satisfying 
              parts of any design endeavour. I value teamwork deeply, and always make sure 
              to communicate with team members to ensure that everyone is content 
              with their undertakings and feels fully supported. Having a team that works 
              well together--a team that can take and give feedback,
              plan, and organize--can be the difference between a good project, and a great one.

              <strong>👁️ Visualization 👁️</strong>
              <p></p>
              As a learner, my strength comes in the form of visualization.
              I prefer to see images and graphs of things, rather than hearing spoken or written instruction.
              As such, in all my design activities, I seek to more easily visualize designs by
              creating sketches, diagrams, and 3D models. It is only through these models that I feels
              I can truly understand the design, its strengths and weakness, and its implications.

            <strong>🧠 Being Open Mindedd 🧠</strong>
            <p></p>
            A bias that I occasionally suffer from is an "initial idea" bias,
            where I become attached to the first idea that comes to mind, and try to justify 
            it even when it may not be the best idea. As an Engineer, I am working on 
            being more open minded to all ideas, and to not be afraid to change my mind 
            when other ideas comes along.

            <strong>🖥️ Learning New Technologies 🖥️</strong>
            <p></p>
            One of my values is to always be learning new technologies; to spread my wings and 
            explore the wide world of tools the world has to offer. I do this because
            I believe that it is important to be well versed in the latest technologies to 
            grow my tool kit and be able to create the best products possible.
            This is also why I love competing in hackathons--they always expose me to a 
            a plethora of industry tools that I have never seen before.

            <strong>📉 Embracing Failure 📈</strong>
            <p></p>
            Failure to me is simply part of learning. It's a sign to me that
            better things will come, as without failure, it is impossible to grow. I have learned
            to embrace each failure as a learning opportunity, and to always strive to
            improve from it.

              Pocket Fridge is an app that scans your receipts, identifies the food items on that receipt, 
              keeps track of the expiration dates,
              places those foods into your

              <strong>🧠 Initial Brainstorming 🧠:</strong>
              The Pocket Fridge idea was the product of 3 hours of brainstorming and outside-the-box thinking--a lot of time
              when there is only 48 hours to submit a project. We came up with this idea when reflecting on our own lives as university students, realizing how 
              busy life could be, how little time there was to think of 
              nutritious recipes, and how easy it was to forget about what's already in your fridge.
              True to my Engineering position, Pocket Fridge
              was indeed an ambitious idea, as it required the integration of multiple AI models
              that we had never worked with, as well as extensive backend and frontend integration. 
              However, our hard worked and brainstorming pay off as we got the key componenets of the app to work, ending up 
              winning the hackathon!"

              <strong>🛠️ How we built it 🛠️:</strong>
              We built Pocket Fridge primarily using the MERN stack, integrating MongoDB for data storage,
              Express.js to handle API requests, React Native for a convenient front-end user interface, 
              and Node.js (hosted/deployed on Railway) for server-side logic.

              We explored countless other technologies throughout this project too, creating a Flask Rest API 
              hosted on Google Cloud to leverage Vertex AI (Gemini Pro Vision, Gemini Pro, and Imagen) and 
              rigorously analyze grocery receipts."

              <strong>💻 How it works (Technical Details) 💻:</strong> Upon the upload of a receipt photo to the app,
                our AI Gemini model — trained using Vertex AI, implemented with Python, and deployed on 
                Google Cloud as an API with Flask — begins its work. Our Gemini AI model analyzes the 
                receipt photo to identify food items and predicts their expiration dates using its cloud 
                capabilities. The data, formatted in JSON, is then sent to the frontend React Native code which 
                reads it in and organizes the different items into the virtual pantry, while keeping track 
                of their predicted expiration dates. Our second AI Gemini model, also harnessed with Vertex AI, 
                takes these identified items and concocts various recipes. This AI creates step-by-step images 
                for each recipe, enhancing user convenience. 🍳"

              <strong>💻 Technical Details Continued 💻:</strong> The AI models are the main 
              branches that I worked on in this project. Coming into the competition, I had very little 
              experience working with AI API's, especially not the newly released Gemini and Google models. 
              This project was therefore quite a challenge. However, 
              harnessing my creativity, discipline, and problem solving skills, I was able to learn how to use
              Vertex AI, Google Cloud API Deployment, and countless other technologies within the 48 hours to integrate
              our AI models into our project. Overall, this demonstrates my key values of discipline as well
              as my important value of 'thinking big'; doing things that I have never done before, and pushing the limits of
              what I think is possible."

              At the time, our team had very little experience with 
              multidiciplinary engineering,
              electrical components, or any engineering at all, yet we decided to be ambitious and create 
              something that on paper, was out of our scope.
              Utilizing the very full 48 hours, we managed to create a working prototype. It wasn't perfect; 
              we never managed to perfectly integrate the rasperry pi OS system and the arduino system to make the 
              project fully autonomous (i.e. work without being plugged into the rasperry pi), and our machine 
              learning model was not as accurate as we had hoped. Yet, we had made a working product, which was a 
              huge accomplishment for us."

              Teamwork was an integral component to this project. Given that our team 
              only had 48 hours and we all had zero hackathon experience, it meant that we had to work
              together, communicate effectively, and divide the work evenly. 
              Overall, our team worked pretty well; we were able to 
              get the most unbelievable components working, but there just was not a lot of time. 
              In this project, I personally worked on setting up the circuits, the arduino,
              and getting the voice and text integrations to work. I also spent a lot of time 
              with my team simply
              researching how to do things, and learning how to use the tools we had never used before.
              All in all, this project is an example of my teamwork and discipline skills which are two of my

              Praxis II, the second Engineering Design course in the Engineering Science Program at UofT, was a 4 months 
              design course in which I worked with Samuel Ho, Allan Zhou, and Ran Chi to create designs for an opportunity
              of a community of our choice. Our community was Allan Gardens, and our opportunity was to help 
              them separate red wiggler worms from the vermicompost with minimal manual labour, as many of the volunteers
              at Allan Gardens were older folks that needed to use a lot of effort to remove worms for vermicomposting.

              We spent about 3-7 hours daily practicing for this final presentation, in hopes that we could
              completely familiarize ourselves with our key 
              points. However, the most important reason for practicing together was to ensure not just a smooth and 
              seamless presentation, but to ensure we were helping each other improve 
              by giving each other constructive feedback. This is a key value that I hold in my engineering that I elaborated
              on in my position, and that I hold dear to my core. Having a team that can give and take feedback, and work
              well together can make or break the project, and so I always take steps to ensure that our team is working
              effectively and cohesively."

              For our Structures and Materials Class (CIV102), our final design project was to design 
              a 2 m bridge using limited matboard and contact cement. The bridge was to endure a test 
              in which a train would be pulled across the bridge. If the bridge 
              did not collapse, more weight would be added to the train until the bridge failed.
              My group, 'No Stress, Maybe Strain', consisting of myself, 
              Allan Zhou, Alex Wang, and 
              Joseph Mi worked together to create what was theoretically a strong bridge, capable of 
              enduring ~1300 N.
              However, it turns out that theory is much different than practice, 
              and our bridge ended up
              breaking during the very first test, placing our bridge in the bottom quartile of the class."

              data-caption="This video is a short timelapse of my group working 
              on building the bridge. Overall, we spent over a month preparing, so it was upsetting
              to see our bridge collapse quickly. However, as said in my Position,
              failures to me are simply a 
              growth experience. This failure taught me that what you learn in class
              often only applies to the ideal world; that what happens in theory can 
              differ significantly from what will actually happen--especially in Engineering, where small
              details and changes can have a huge impact.
              
              Our bridge, which was  
              calculated to carry >1200 N, ended up carying just 50 N, failing
              from a strong torsion propogating a shear force between 
              the matboard layers, which was not accounted for in our calculations, and not taught in class.
              
              Realizing the important of actual Engineering Practice, the failure of our bridge 
              sparked me to join hackathons and design teams where I would be able to learn practical 
              engineering skills I could only learn from experience." >

              data-caption="This attached PDF features all the different iterations of our bridge cross section, 
              each iteration building off the last. The iteration process for creating the optimal bridge was a very delicate 
              process, as you needed to both ensure the factor of safety (FOS) 
              was high, yet very similar for all modes of failure. This is since even if 
              you your bridge had a high FOS for say compression, if the FOS was low for 
              thin plate buckling, your bridge would fail very early. Overall, our group balanced the FOS values
              between 4 modes of thin plate buckling, compression, tension, and 2 modes of shear. 
              With regards to the PDF, I created the mockups using Adobe Illustrator in order to create a clear 
              clear presentation of the different iterations, hoping to improve the presentation of our designs,
              which is one of my key values.">

              This picture features our final bridge's dimension which I modelled in Sketchup 3d. 
              'No Stress, Maybe Shear' is a tall bridge to endure lots of 
              bottom-side tension, featuring a thin top flange to endure compression, which was relatively
              weaker than the tension forces. What we did not account for was how when actually building
              the bridge, the connection
              between the two pieces of matboard would be the weakest point, as it is simply
              something you can not account for in calculations. This is a key lesson that I learned;
              that when creating a product, to look beyond calculations, and also consider practical
              issues that may arise."
